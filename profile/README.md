## üó≥Ô∏è Jenkins Board and Officer Elections 2023
We are excited to announce the 2023 Jenkins Governance Board elections! The nomination and voter registration period is now open. Nominations can be submitted for [two governance board](https://www.jenkins.io/project/board) positions, and all [five officer](https://www.jenkins.io/project/team-leads/) positions (Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation).

These roles are crucial to the expanding community and continued progress of Jenkins. This is an opportunity for Jenkins contributors and community members to sign up to vote in elections, and acknowledge other community members by nominating them for a position.

See [the announcement blogpost](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2023/09/18/board-officer-election-announcement/) for more details how to register for voting and nominate candidates.
